Staying ahead in the iGaming marketplace means understanding every factor influencing digital asset value and online casino investments. As environmental data becomes more accessible, tools like the air quality map are emerging as unlikely but powerful resources for iGaming professionals. Whether you’re looking to buy online casinos, sell affiliate websites, or identify promising iGaming assets for sale, integrating fresh perspectives can unlock new investment opportunities.

## How Air Quality Maps Impact iGaming Asset Value

Today’s iGaming M&A platform users are increasingly data-driven. While metrics like traffic, SEO performance, and revenue remain crucial, environmental factors—such as air quality—are gaining traction. But why should iGaming investors care about air quality maps?
