The iGaming industry continues to expand rapidly, offering lucrative opportunities for investors, entrepreneurs, and operators worldwide. Data and analytics from leading sources like Statista reveal compelling trends: the global online gambling market is projected to surpass $95 billion by 2025, with online casinos and affiliate websites leading the charge. As this sector matures, demand for trusted platforms to buy and sell iGaming assets is stronger than ever.

## Why Data Matters in the iGaming Marketplace

Accurate, up-to-date market intelligence is crucial for making strategic decisions—whether you’re looking to buy online casinos, sell affiliate websites, or diversify your digital gambling investments. Statista reports show that mobile gambling, sports betting, and online casino platforms are experiencing double-digit growth, especially across regulated regions in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific.
