The intersection of PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) events and the iGaming marketplace is creating significant momentum among investors, operators, and affiliates. As the popularity of golf surges globally, online casinos, sportsbooks, and affiliate websites are seizing new opportunities to engage audiences and drive revenue through PGA-themed betting, fantasy leagues, and exclusive gaming partnerships.

## How PGA Drives Demand for iGaming Assets
