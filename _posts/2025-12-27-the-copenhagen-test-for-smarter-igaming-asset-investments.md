When it comes to buying and selling iGaming assets, making the right investment decision is critical. The Copenhagen Test has emerged as a practical approach for industry professionals looking to assess online casinos, affiliate websites, and other digital gambling businesses listed on an iGaming marketplace like UpperMatch. But what does the Copenhagen Test mean for investors, sellers, and brokers in the iGaming M&A space?

## What Is the Copenhagen Test?

The Copenhagen Test is a strategic checklist used by iGaming investors and sellers to evaluate whether an iGaming asset—be it an online casino, affiliate website, or digital gambling business—meets the standards required for a successful global transaction. Originating from best practices in Copenhagen, this test focuses on transparency, compliance, scalability, and operational integrity.

In today's global iGaming marketplace, applying the Copenhagen Test means ensuring an asset can withstand regulatory scrutiny, deliver consistent revenue, and attract serious buyers or investors. For those looking to buy online casinos or sell affiliate websites, this framework provides clarity and confidence in high-value transactions.

Whether you're listing iGaming assets for sale or performing due diligence as a buyer, the Copenhagen Test brings focus to several essential factors:
