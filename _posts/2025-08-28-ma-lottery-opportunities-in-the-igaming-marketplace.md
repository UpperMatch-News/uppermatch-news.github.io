Massachusetts has long been known for its robust lottery scene, with the MA Lottery drawing attention from players and investors alike. As digital gaming and online gambling continue to expand, the intersection between traditional lotteries and the online iGaming marketplace is creating new possibilities for growth, acquisition, and investment. 

## The Evolution of Lottery Assets in iGaming

The global iGaming marketplace is rapidly integrating lottery assets, reflecting a shift from brick-and-mortar outlets to digital platforms.
